### Design Choices

This application was designed following a modular approach for ease of maintenance and scalability:

- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express, the backend uses REST APIs for data management. It includes:
  - **Role-based access control**: Ensuring restricted access based on user roles (Manager, Employee).
  - **Data models**: Sequelize ORM is used to define `User`, `Project`, and `Task` models, which enable data validation and complex relationships.
  - **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication is implemented for secure session management.
  
- **Frontend**: Developed with React, the frontend interacts with backend APIs for data operations.
  - **Role-sensitive UI**: Components and actions are conditionally rendered based on the userâ€™s role.
  - **Routing and Protected Routes**: Used React Router for navigation and PrivateRoute utility for secure access to protected routes.
